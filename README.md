## Library "WinRegistry"
The WinRegistry provides a set of functionalities for interacting with the Windows registry, a hierarchical database used to store configuration settings and options for the operating system, software applications, and user preferences on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Key features of the WinRegistry extension include:
1) Registry Access: It enables reading from and writing to the Windows registry, allowing users to retrieve and modify registry keys, subkeys, and values.
2) Registry Entry Representation: The extension provides classes such as Entry to represent individual registry entries, encapsulating properties like registry hive, path, name, value, and value kind.
3) Type-Safe Operations: WinRegistry facilitates type-safe operations by providing methods to handle various data types supported by the Windows registry, such as strings, integers, booleans.

Overall, the WinRegistry library from CSharpLibraSuite simplifies the process of working with the Windows registry, offering a convenient and robust solution for managing registry settings and configurations in Windows-based applications and systems.
